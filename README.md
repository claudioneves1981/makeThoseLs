# Make those L's!
A little "educational" git, trying to make a "L" in every way possible, with every language possible.

Do the L!

# How can I contribute?
Just make a code file, with everything needed to make a despiction of what a "L" is. You can use the character, you can use div elements, you can use &block;, you can use EVERYTHING. Just pick up your preferred language and, Do the L! Remember: More cryptic code = more awesome!

Also, you can make an L using a language that already exists. Just make sure to put an identifier suffix on the filename (e.g. _0, _1, _2, etc...)
